# Project-2 - WWE Wrestlers
Data analysis - Python, API, Web Scrapping

![logo](https://github.com/lauurasarabia/Project-2/blob/main/images/logo-WWE.png?raw=true)


Our main available tool to carry out this project was the WWE Wrestlers personal data (name, date of birth, n¬∫ of titles, etc).
This database has been cleaned and prepared for being analysed ("1_WWWE_Wrestlers"). 
We are going to use this information in order to discover which horoscope are each of them.

Do you think that their horoscope had something to do with their wins?

On the other hand, we are going to discover who was their adversary in their final battle via Web Scraping ("2_Scraping").

On "3_Visualizations" you can see who are our top 5 Wrestlers, which is the horoscope with more wins and an extract of Taurus vs Sagittarius battles.

We have also used an API which takes both names (winner and defeated) and makes a love percentage compatibility between them (4_API).
